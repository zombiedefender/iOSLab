# iOSLab

This repostory is about our ios lab and homeworks.
- RottenHW: is about getting response from API then put a table view and a detail view by the response. 
  I get stuck since I seperate the API as adata controller then I have to reload when there have the API response.
  I don't know how to fix it now. 
  Thanks for knowing my struggle.
