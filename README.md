# iOSLab

This repostory is about our ios lab and homeworks.
- DigitalClock: This is about a L1 homework of display current time on the screen. The push button haven't finish yet.

- Prework: It is about caculate the amount and the tip value after user input. The assignment needs us to keep the default setting which I haven's find the way to get there ... 

- RottenHW: It is about getting response from API then put a table view and a detail view by the response. 
  I get stuck since I seperate the API as adata controller then I have to reload when there have the API response.
  I don't know how to fix it now. 
  Thanks for knowing my struggle.
